Hi Daniel,
Thank you for reaching out about the Linux hostname authentication failures after your recent OS patch.
I understand this is impacting your environment significantly since you have 100's of applications that may need authentication list updates, and I'm here to help.

### What I understand:
After a recent OS patch on your Linux servers (CP v14.00, CLIPasswordsdk), the Application Password Providers started failing Allowed Machine Authentication.
The providers were originally whitelisted using their short hostname (SGDPSR00002), but after the patch, the FQDN (SGDP.int.bar.com) is being used instead.
A host file entry was also removed during the patch.

### The Solution:
1. **Verify the hostname change**: Run `hostname -f` on affected servers to confirm the FQDN is now being reported instead of the short name. This is what CyberArk's Application Password Provider uses to identify the machine.

2. **Update authentication lists**: For immediate resolution, add the new FQDN (SGDP.int.bar.com) to your Application's authentication list in CyberArk. This will allow the providers to authenticate with the new hostname.

3. **Long-term solution**: Work with your Linux team to either restore the host file entries or standardize on FQDN-based authentication across all your applications to prevent this issue in future patches.

### I'm attaching:
- Screenshot showing how to update the authentication list in PVWA
- Link to detailed guide: https://community.cyberark.com/s/article/How-does-the-Application-Password-Provider-determine-server-s-IP-address


### Next Steps:
Please test these changes on a few test applications first and update me within 24 hours.
If you encounter any issues or need help with bulk updates across your 100's of applications, I'm available for a Zoom call to discuss automation options or scripting solutions.

Best regards,
Diego
