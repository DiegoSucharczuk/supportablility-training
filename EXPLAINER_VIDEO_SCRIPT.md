> Before sending anything to AI, your data is automatically sanitized. The system detects and replaces sensitive information like customer names, domain names, IP addresses, and email addresses with dummy data. You see exactly what's being changed in a side-by-side comparison. This protects customer privacy while still getting valuable feedback.

> Once approved, the AI analyzes your communication, searches for technical solutions if requested, and then automatically restores all the real customer information in the final response. You get detailed feedback on what works, what needs improvement, and a perfectly formatted response ready to copy and paste—with the actual customer names and details intact."
