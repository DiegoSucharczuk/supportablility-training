**GOAL:** I need you to act as a communication coach and analyze technical support responses against 12 professional communication principles. Your analysis will help support engineers improve their client-facing communication skills.

**WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:**

1. **Analyze the support response** against the 12 principles below
2. **Provide actionable feedback** on what was done well and what needs improvement
3. **Evaluate each principle** with a ✓ (good) or ⚠️ (needs work) and a brief comment
4. **Rewrite the response** using proper structure and empathy

**THE 12 COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES TO EVALUATE:**

1. **Building Trust** - Consistency, transparency, reliability
2. **Active Listening** - Understanding needs through reflection and clarification
3. **Clear Communication** - Positive, direct language that avoids ambiguity
4. **Taking Ownership** - Demonstrating responsibility for issues
5. **Smart Empathy** - Linking client impact to immediate actions (not just sympathy)
6. **Proactive Updates** - Updating clients before they ask
7. **Ice Breaking** - Creating pleasant atmosphere and personal connection
8. **Early Questions** - Gathering critical information upfront
9. **Sense of Urgency** - Conveying commitment and speed
10. **Shared Responsibility** - Using "we" language (not "you have a problem")
11. **Win-Win Solutions** - Finding solutions that benefit both parties
12. **Structured Responses** - Clear, organized communication with logical flow

**KEY GUIDELINES:**
- Never say "I don't know" without a follow-up plan
- Avoid blaming language: "you have a problem" → "we see unusual behavior"
- Use collaborative language: "let's check together"
- Show empathy but always link it to action
- Be specific, avoid vague promises like "soon"
- Maintain professional tone even under pressure
